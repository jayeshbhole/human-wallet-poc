# One - AA Human Wallet

> TLDR;
> "A Wallet Experience for Humans; Not Crypto/Web3"

Wallets have been one of the most worked on projects in the web3 world. Many of the pioneers of this space have wallets that have a huge user base but they require high prerequisites of understanding and maintaining the accounts. In terms of safety, recovery and even actions as simple as a transfer.

One Wallet provides an abstracted user interface where users can create and log into their wallets using their phone numbers!
With the ability to add new devices on the fly, One provides a very quick onboarding for the users.

One wallet is built for simplicity and ease of understanding, with a need-to-know user experience design. Sending ETH and logging into your account on infinite devices are the first few features of the One Wallet.
